									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Mohamed Ismail works as a data engineer at Sopra Steria. He holds a master's degree in Computational Science from the University of Oslo, specializing in calculations and simulations of solar cell materials using data science and machine learning. Through this education, Mohamed has been exposed to a variety of technologies in data and programming. This includes foundational knowledge in programming and natural sciences such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, various programming languages like Python, C/C++, and Java, and advanced technologies and algorithms in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.</p>

									<p>Previously, Mohamed worked as a junior data scientist at a startup company named Future Ready. His work at Future Ready involved creating a digital learning platform that simulated a sales call to train future telemarketers. He achieved this by processing and analyzing audio recordings of past sales calls using data analysis tools like Python, cloud services like Microsoft Azure for handling security concerns, and Git for version control. To realize this, Mohamed worked with a cross-functional team, including designers, telemarketers, developers, and business personnel. This experience helped Mohamed collaborate at a higher level than before.</p>

									<p>Mohamed has also gained considerable experience as a leader. His leadership skills were particularly developed during his time in the leadership program Teach First Norway. During the program, Mohamed worked as a teacher at a challenging school in Oslo. Through the leadership program, Mohamed completed a full-time teacher education and leadership course in collaboration with Equinor, while simultaneously working full-time as a teacher. This has enhanced Mohamed's communication skills, especially in conveying difficult concepts to others outside his own field in a more understandable way.</p>

									<p>Mohamed thrives best when working on complex challenges together with a skilled team. He is also a self-driven person who works hard to find connections to gain a holistic view of the challenges he is working on.</p>

									<p>In his spare time, Mohamed is a globe-trotter who loves to travel by himself as a backpacker. He has backpacked through many different countries across various continents, including Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Japan in Asia; Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda in Africa; and Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia in South America. His goal is to travel to every continent and visit as many countries as possible.</p>
