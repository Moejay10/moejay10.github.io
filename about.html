									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Mohamed Ismail works as a data engineer at the Norwegian Tax Administration (Skatteetaten), where he contributes to the development and maintenance of the organization's cloud-based data and analytics platform, built on Databricks and Azure. His work focuses on building scalable ELT pipelines, data modeling, quality assurance, CI/CD practices, and supporting data product teams across various domains. He also plays a role in improving the developer experience and usability of the platform by maintaining reusable components and documentation.</p>

									<p>Prior to joining Skatteetaten, Mohamed worked as a data engineer at Sopra Steria. There, he developed and optimized data pipelines, automated workflows, and contributed to building robust cloud-based data solutions using tools like Azure, and Python. This role provided him valuable experience in private-sector digital transformation projects and large-scale data platforms.</p>

									<p>He holds a master's degree in Computational Science from the University of Oslo, specializing in simulations of solar cell materials using data science and machine learning. Through this education, Mohamed gained exposure to a wide range of technologies in programming and data, including foundational knowledge in natural sciences (mathematics, physics, chemistry), programming languages such as Python, C/C++, and Java, and advanced methods in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.</p>

									<p>Previously, Mohamed worked as a junior data scientist at a startup called Future Ready, where he helped develop a digital learning platform that simulated sales calls to train future telemarketers. He processed and analyzed audio recordings using Python and machine learning techniques and collaborated with a cross-functional team, including designers, developers, and business professionals. This experience strengthened his ability to deliver data-driven solutions in interdisciplinary settings.</p>

									<p>Mohamed also has solid leadership experience. Through the Teach First Norway program, he worked as a teacher in a challenging Oslo school while simultaneously completing a full-time teacher education and leadership course in partnership with Equinor. This experience sharpened his ability to communicate complex concepts to diverse audiences and taught him how to lead under pressure.</p>

									<p>He thrives when working on complex challenges as part of a skilled and collaborative team. Mohamed is self-driven and passionate about learning, always seeking to understand systems holistically and uncover the deeper patterns behind the problems he solves.</p>

									<p>In his spare time, Mohamed is a globe-trotter who enjoys backpacking solo across continents. He has traveled extensively through countries in Asia, Africa, and South America, including Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Japan, Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. His goal is to visit every continent and experience as many cultures as possible.</p>
